# Important Point from IP addresses :
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be generated by a modem or router using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

# Important Point from Port numbers.
In networking, every application or service running on a device uses a port number to ensure that data is delivered to the correct application.

Modem: Connecting to your ISP and converting signals for internet access.
By itself, a modem usually connects to one device only (e.g., a single computer).
<br>
Routers have a global (public) IP address assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP), and this address is used for communication with servers on the internet. 
<br>
When the server sends the response to the router's global IP address then
the router uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to forward the data to the correct device in your local network.
<br>

# LAN , MAN , WAN 
Example of LAN : Home wifi router, office wifi router.
<br>
Example of MAN : Public Wifi Network provided across a city and local ISP's.
<br>
Example of WAN : Optical fibres and large ISP like TaTa ISP.

# Flow Control 
Flow control refers to a technique in data communication that ensures the sender and receiver operate at compatible speeds, so the receiver is not overwhelmed by data it cannot process in time. 

# MAC Addressing :
A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication on a physical network. It is used in the Data Link Layer of the OSI model to ensure devices can be uniquely identified within a local network.
<br>
When a device knows another device's IP address but not its MAC address, it uses ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) to map the IP to the corresponding MAC address.
<br>
A computer's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters have different MAC addresses because each network interface controller (NIC) in a device is assigned its own unique MAC address.

#  BitTorrent 
It is a prime example of a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture, where devices (peers) communicate directly with each other without relying on a centralized server for data exchange.

# SSL 
SSL/TLS is often associated with the Session Layer because it establishes, manages, and terminates secure sessions between devices.
<br>

# Ephemeral ports 
These are temporary ports assigned by a computer's operating system to a client application for the duration of a communication session when several tabs of a single application like Chrome. These ports are used for outbound connections and are automatically allocated from a predefined range when needed.

# TCP 
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) establishes a reliable connection between a client and a server before transferring data.

# Important Point from Network Layer : 
In dynamic Routing, Dijkstra Algorthm is used to find the shortest path.
<br>
Hop by Hop things happens on the ISP.
<br>
Routing Table contains the block of addresses which are assigned to the ISP.
<br>
Internet Society creates Classes for IP addresses.
<br>
IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force) : It provides the IP addresses to ISP based on the regions not on the classes.

# Important point from Stateful Firewalls(a type of Middle Box) :
It stores similar data packets in the cache memory which can be allowed or denied.
<br>
Network Address Translator (NAT) typically exists on the boundary router or gateway device that connects a local (private) network to the public internet. 
<br>
NAT serves several important purposes:
<br>
1. Conservation of IPv4 Addresses
IPv4 has a limited number of addresses (approximately 4.3 billion), which is insufficient for the growing number of devices.
<br>
NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address, significantly reducing the number of public IPs required.
<br>
2. Private IP Addressing
NAT enables devices using private IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x) to communicate with devices on the public internet.
<br>
These private IP addresses are not routable on the internet and must be translated to a public IP address.
<br>
3. Security
NAT provides a basic level of security by hiding internal network details. External devices only see the public IP address of the NAT device, not the internal private IP addresses.
This reduces the attack surface for devices within the private network.
<br>
4. Load Balancing
NAT can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers or devices, enabling load balancing.
For example, in port forwarding, NAT maps external requests to specific internal devices or services.
<br>

# Important Point from Data Link Layer :
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a communication protocol used to map an IP address (logical address) to a corresponding MAC address (physical address) within a local network.
<br>
In a local network (e.g., Ethernet), devices use MAC addresses to communicate at the hardware level. However, applications and protocols (e.g., TCP/IP) rely on IP addresses to identify devices. ARP resolves this discrepancy by finding the MAC address associated with a specific IP address.
<br>
How Does ARP Work?
<br>
Broadcast Request:
When a device wants to communicate with another device in the same local network but only knows the target's IP address:
<br>
It sends an ARP Request packet to all devices on the network (broadcast), asking, "Who has this IP address?"
ARP requrst packet contains MAC Address of sender, IP address of destination which is called frame.
<br>
Unicast Reply:
The device with the requested IP address responds with an ARP Reply containing its MAC address.
<br>
Cache the Result:
To reduce future broadcasts, the device stores the resolved MAC address and IP address mapping in its ARP cache for a short time.
<br>
Example: 
<br>
If the router knows the destination IP address of the target device (assigned by the DHCP server).
If the router does not have the corresponding MAC address in its ARP cache, it sends an ARP request on the local network:
The ARP request asks, "Who has this IP address?"
The target device replies with its MAC address (ARP response)
