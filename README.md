# Important Point from IP addresses :

IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be generated by a modem or router using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

# Important Point from Port numbers.

In networking, every application or service running on a device uses a port number to ensure that data is delivered to the correct application.

Modem: Connecting to your ISP and converting signals for internet access.
By itself, a modem usually connects to one device only (e.g., a single computer).
<br>
Routers have a global (public) IP address assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP), and this address is used for communication with servers on the internet. 
<br>
When the server sends the response to the router's global IP address then
the router uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to forward the data to the correct device in your local network.
<br>

# LAN , MAN , WAN

Example of LAN : Home wifi router, office wifi router.
<br>
Example of MAN : Public Wifi Network provided across a city and local ISP's.
<br>
Example of WAN : Optical fibres and large ISP like TaTa ISP.

# Network Topology:
Topology: It refers to how the different computers are connected to each other. 
<br>
1. Bus Topology
<br>
2. Ring (Token Base)
<br>
3. Star (Client Server)
<br>
4. Hierarchical (In the Hierachical form) 
<br>
5. Hybrid (Bus + star) 
<br>
6. Mesh 

# Public and Private ip address :

Routers have assigned public ip address by the ISP.
<br>
Our Cellular phones have private ip address by CGNAT (Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation) used by mobile carriers and if we connected to wifi. It also assigns private ip addresses using DHCP.

# RFC

It stands for request for comment.
RFC documents contain technical specifications and organizational notes for the Internet and are the core output of the IETF.
<br>
More information : https://www.ietf.org/process/rfcs/

# Wireshark

It is packet sniffing and packet capturing tool.
Sniffing means finding and analysing the data packet which is being transfered or received and know more details about it.

# ICMP :

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used for reporting errors and performing network diagnostics.

# SONET

It is a standardized digital communication protocol used to transmit large amounts of data over optical fiber networks. SONET is primarily used in telecommunications and allows the simultaneous transmission of multiple digital streams, ensuring high-speed data transfer and efficient bandwidth utilization.
<br>

Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted theoretically over a network connection or communication channel within a specific period of time, typically measured in bits per second (bps).
<br>
Throughput is the actual amount of data that is transmitted over a network connection within a specific period of time .
<br>
Latency is the total time taken by the data to reach its destinatition from source.

# Frame relay :

Frame Relay is a wide-area network (WAN) technology that enables the efficient transmission of data between devices across a network. It is based on packet-switching, where data is divided into small, variable-sized units called frames and sent over virtual circuits(paths for consistent communication).
<br>
Frame Relay Switches: It is one of the device which is
Operated by the service provider within their network infrastructure.
Responsible for routing frames across the network using virtual circuits

# Flow Control

Flow control refers to a technique in data communication that ensures the sender and receiver operate at compatible speeds, so the receiver is not overwhelmed by data it cannot process in time.

# MAC Addressing :

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication on a physical network. It is used in the Data Link Layer of the OSI model to ensure devices can be uniquely identified within a local network.
<br>
When a device knows another device's IP address but not its MAC address, it uses ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) to map the IP to the corresponding MAC address.
<br>
A computer's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters have different MAC addresses because each network interface controller (NIC) in a device is assigned its own unique MAC address.

# BitTorrent

It is a prime example of a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture, where devices (peers) communicate directly with each other without relying on a centralized server for data exchange.

# SSL

SSL/TLS is often associated with the Session Layer because it establishes, manages, and terminates secure sessions between devices.
<br>

# Ephemeral ports

These are temporary ports assigned by a computer's operating system to a client application for the duration of a communication session when several tabs of a single application like Chrome. These ports are used for outbound connections and are automatically allocated from a predefined range when needed.

# TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) establishes a reliable connection between a client and a server before transferring data.

# Third-party cookies

Third-party cookies are cookies created by domains other than the website you are currently visiting. These cookies are commonly used for tracking users across websites, enabling targeted advertisements, analytics, and social media functionalities.
<br>
Example:
<br>
You visit example.com (first-party site).
The page includes an ad or tracking script from adnetwork.com.
A cookie from adnetwork.com is stored in your browser, tracking your activities across other websites that also load adnetwork.com.

# socket

A socket is a software abstraction that facilitates communication between two programs, typically over a network. It acts as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across a network or within the same machine.
<br>
A socket is defined by a combination of:
IP Address: Identifies the host or device.
Port Number: Identifies the specific application or service on the host
<br>
When a socket is created, it can either:
Use a specific port number explicitly provided (e.g., binding to port 80 for HTTP).
Allow the OS to assign a random available port if no specific port is provided.

# Multiplexing and Demultiplexing at Transport layer :

Multiplexing (Sender-Side)
Multiplexing refers to combining data from multiple processes or sources into a single communication stream for transmission to the server.
<br>
How It Works:
<br>
The sender (usually a client) has multiple applications or processes that need to communicate with the server.
Each application is identified by a port number.
The transport layer (e.g., TCP or UDP) attaches a port number to each application's data, creating a unique identifier for the data (e.g., <source IP>:<source port>).
Data from multiple applications is combined and sent over the shared network.
<br>
Example:
A web browser (using port 80 for HTTP) and an email client (using port 25 for SMTP and if TLS then port 585 is used) both send data over the same network connection. The transport layer adds port numbers to differentiate the data.
<br>
<b>2. Demultiplexing (Receiver-Side)</b>
Demultiplexing is the reverse process of multiplexing: the server separates the received data and delivers it to the appropriate application based on its port number.
<br>
How It Works:
<br>
The server receives the combined data stream.
The transport layer examines the destination port number in the header of each data packet.
Based on the port number, the data is delivered to the corresponding application or process running on the server.
<br>
Example:
The server receives a packet for port 80 (web server) and another for port 25 (email server). It routes the packets to the respective applications.

# Important point from duplex :

Simplex : only from one end, data can be sent like : Radio FM.
<br>
Half Duplex : Data can be sent from both side but only one at one time like
Woky toky.
<br>
Full Duplex : Data can be sent from both device simultaneousaly from both side like real time application.
<br>
Pager is the first device which is used to send the text data.

# Congestion Control

Congestion control is a mechanism used in computer networks to prevent or mitigate network congestion, which occurs when too much data is sent over a network, leading to performance degradation such as packet loss, delays, or reduced throughput.

# Important Point from Network Layer :

In dynamic Routing, Dijkstra Algorthm is used to find the shortest path.
<br>
Hop by Hop things happens on the ISP.
<br>
Routing Table contains the block of addresses which are assigned to the ISP.
<br>
Internet Society creates Classes for IP addresses.
<br>
IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force) : It provides the IP addresses to ISP based on the regions not on the classes.

# Important point from Stateful Firewalls(a type of Middle Box) :

It stores similar data packets in the cache memory which can be allowed or denied.
<br>
Network Address Translator (NAT) typically exists on the boundary router or gateway device that connects a local (private) network to the public internet.
<br>
NAT serves several important purposes:
<br>

1. Conservation of IPv4 Addresses
   IPv4 has a limited number of addresses (approximately 4.3 billion), which is insufficient for the growing number of devices.
   <br>
   NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address, significantly reducing the number of public IPs required.
   <br>
2. Private IP Addressing
   NAT enables devices using private IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x) to communicate with devices on the public internet.
   <br>
   These private IP addresses are not routable on the internet and must be translated to a public IP address.
   <br>
3. Security
   NAT provides a basic level of security by hiding internal network details. External devices only see the public IP address of the NAT device, not the internal private IP addresses.
   This reduces the attack surface for devices within the private network.
   <br>
4. Load Balancing
   NAT can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers or devices, enabling load balancing.
   For example, in port forwarding, NAT maps external requests to specific internal devices or services.
   <br>

# Important Point from Data Link Layer :

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a communication protocol used to map an IP address (logical address) to a corresponding MAC address (physical address) within a local network.
<br>
In a local network (e.g., Ethernet), devices use MAC addresses to communicate at the hardware level. However, applications and protocols (e.g., TCP/IP) rely on IP addresses to identify devices. ARP resolves this discrepancy by finding the MAC address associated with a specific IP address.
<br>
How Does ARP Work?
<br>
Broadcast Request:
When a device wants to communicate with another device in the same local network but only knows the target's IP address:
<br>
It sends an ARP Request packet to all devices on the network (broadcast), asking, "Who has this IP address?"
ARP requrst packet contains MAC Address of sender, IP address of destination which is called frame.
<br>
Unicast Reply:
The device with the requested IP address responds with an ARP Reply containing its MAC address.
<br>
Cache the Result:
To reduce future broadcasts, the device stores the resolved MAC address and IP address mapping in its ARP cache for a short time.
<br>
Example:
<br>
If the router knows the destination IP address of the target device (assigned by the DHCP server).
If the router does not have the corresponding MAC address in its ARP cache, it sends an ARP request on the local network:
The ARP request asks, "Who has this IP address?"
The target device replies with its MAC address (ARP response)
<br>

# RARP 
RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol used to map a device’s MAC (Media Access Control) address to an IP (Internet Protocol) address.
<br>
How RARP Works
<br>
A diskless device (like a thin client or a networked workstation) does not know its IP address at startup.
<br>
It broadcasts a RARP request on the network, asking “What is my IP address?” while including its MAC address.
<br>
A RARP server, which has a table mapping MAC addresses to IP addresses, responds with the corresponding IP address.
<br>
The device receives its IP address and can now communicate over the network.

# Remote Login using SSH :
RDP ( for Windows)
<br>
Putty (for Remote server login )

# In 3G, 4G and 5G and 6G :

Thee major difference is bandwidth or we can say the difference in the range of their frequency.

# Physical Layer

There are two ways to transfer the data from router/modem to your computer/laptop or mobile .

1. wireless : radio waves are used in the wireless.
   like : TV signal and FM radio.
   <br>
2. Wired : There are two types of wire.
   <br>
   (i) Coaxial : It is used in wire connect your antena to your TV.
   <br>
   (ii) UTP/STP : It is used in Ethernet cables. It can be shielded or unshielded.
   <br>
   (iii) Optical Fibre : It is used for transfer the data to far places like optical fibres are submerged under the water to connect one country to another.

# Cellular Network :

A wide-area wireless communication system that uses cell towers (base stations) to provide network access to mobile devices over licensed radio frequency bands.
<br>
A cell is a geographical area covered by a base station's radio signals.

# Wifi: Wireless-Fidelity :

A local-area wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet or communicate with each other over unlicensed frequency bands.

# UE and RAN

UE means User Equipment. UE refers to the devices that connect to the cellular network. Examples:

Mobile phones
Tablets
Laptops with cellular connectivity
IoT devices with cellular modems (e.g., smart meters, smartwatches)
<br>
RAN : It stands for Radio Access Network. RAN is the part of the cellular network that connects UE to the core network using radio signals.
<br>
Components:
<br>
Base Stations: Known as eNodeB in 4G or gNodeB in 5G. These manage radio communication with UE.
<br>
Antennas: Facilitate the transmission and reception of radio signals.
<br>
Backhaul Links: Connect the base stations to the core network.

# Evolution in 5G

UE: 5G UEs are designed to support higher frequencies (mmWave), advanced modulation schemes, and multiple antennas for better performance.
<br>
RAN: 5G RAN introduces concepts like Cloud RAN (C-RAN) and Open RAN (O-RAN), which virtualize and open up the RAN architecture for greater flexibility and interoperability.

# How HTTPS works in client server archietecture :

1. Client Requests a Secure Connection
   The client (e.g., a web browser) types a URL with https:// or clicks a link to a secure website.
   The browser sends a TCP connection request to the server on port 443 (default for HTTPS).Then there is 3 way hanshake(SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK) takes place to establishes a TCP connection and After the TCP handshake, the TLS handshake begins to establish a secure connection(in case of HTTPs not in case of HTTP).  
   <br>
2. Server Responds with SSL/TLS Certificate (TLS Handshake)
   The server sends an SSL/TLS certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
   This certificate contains:
   The public key
   The server's domain name
   Information about the issuing CA
   <br>
3. Client Verifies the Certificate
   The client checks the certificate against a trusted CA list.
   If valid, the handshake proceeds; otherwise, the browser warns the user about an insecure connection.
   <br>
4. Key Exchange & Secure Connection Establishment
   The client and server use asymmetric encryption (public-private key cryptography) to establish a shared secret key.
   This shared key is then used for symmetric encryption in the session.
   <br>
5. Encrypted Data Exchange
   Once the session key is established, the client and server use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or another cipher to encrypt all further communication.
   This prevents eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data tampering.
   <br>
6. Client Sends Request, Server Responds Securely
   The client sends an HTTP request (e.g., GET, POST) over the encrypted channel.
   The server processes the request and responds with an encrypted HTTP response.
   <br>
7. Secure Session Ends
   When the session ends (e.g., the user closes the browser), the encrypted connection is closed.

<br>
```bash

In asymmetric cryptography, a shared secret key is typically generated using a key exchange algorithm, such as Diffie-Hellman (DH) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH). Here's how it works:

1. Key Generation (Asymmetric Pair)
Both the client and server generate their own private and public key pairs:

Client: Generates (PrivateKey_C, PublicKey_C)
Server: Generates (PrivateKey_S, PublicKey_S)
2. Public Key Exchange
The client sends its PublicKey_C to the server.
The server sends its PublicKey_S to the client.
3. Shared Secret Computation
Using their private keys and the received public key, both parties compute the shared secret:

Client computes: SharedSecret = Function(PrivateKey_C, PublicKey_S)
Server computes: SharedSecret = Function(PrivateKey_S, PublicKey_C)
4. Result: Identical Shared Secret
Due to the mathematical properties of the algorithm, both computations result in the same shared secret.

Example: Diffie-Hellman (DH) Key Exchange
For DH, the steps are:

Choose a prime number p and a generator g (public parameters).

Key Pair Generation
Client picks a private key a and computes A = g^a mod p.
Server picks a private key b and computes B = g^b mod p.
Exchange Public Keys (A and B).

Compute Shared Secret
Client: S = B^a mod p
Server: S = A^b mod p

Both sides get the same S.

Why Use Asymmetric Cryptography for a Shared Secret?

Asymmetric key exchange allows two parties to securely derive a shared secret over an untrusted network. Once the shared secret is established, it is often used to derive a symmetric key (e.g., for AES encryption), since symmetric encryption is faster and more efficient.

# FTP 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a network.
<br>
It helps the website designer to upload the files to their web servers. 
<br>
It is not secured because data is not encrypted. 
<br>
It uses port 21. 

# SFTP : 
Secure File Transfer Protocol : It is also similar to FTP but it adds a layer of security. 
Here Data is encrypted using secure shell. It authenticates user and server. 
It uses port 22.
<br>

Note : Both FTP and SFTP are connection oriented protocols. They both uses TCP for file transfer. 
<br>

# TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol): 
It is connectionless protocol which is mainly used for transferring files within a local area network. It is not used to transfer files over the network. For example: 
<br>
Transferring the firewalls to system in an office . 
<br>
It uses UDP instead of TCP. 
<br>

# DNS (Domain Name System):
when we search any url on the browser then os goes to check its intial cache if its ip address exist or not then it goes to the ISP(called Recursive Resolver) and if not found then it goes to the Root Name server and if not found it goes to Top Level Domain and if not found then it goes to Autherative Name Server. 
<br>
<br>

```bash 
Configure DNS Records

A Record : (IPv4 Address)
Purpose: Points your domain to an IPv4 address of your server.
Settings:
Host: @ (for root domain) or subdomain (if applicable)
Points to: Your server’s IPv4 address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
TTL: Set to default (or 600 for faster updates)


Here,
TTL (Time to Live) defines how long a DNS record is cached by DNS resolvers before they request a fresh copy from the authoritative nameserver(Refresh Time).




AAAA Record: (IPv6 Address)
Purpose: Same as A Record but for IPv6.
Settings:
Host: @ or subdomain
Points to: Your IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:db8::1)
TTL: Default or 600




CNAME Record: (Alias)
Purpose: Maps a subdomain to another domain name.
Settings:
Host: www (or another subdomain)
Points to: Your domain (example.com) or another hostname
TTL: Default



MX Record (Mail Exchange)
Purpose: Routes email to your mail server.
Settings:
Host: @
Points to: Your mail server address (e.g., mail.example.com)
Priority: Lower value = higher priority (e.g., 10, 20)
TTL: Default




TXT Record (Verification & SPF, DKIM, etc.)
Purpose: Used for domain verification, SPF, DKIM, and security settings.
Settings:
Host: @ or _dmarc (for DMARC)
Value: TXT string provided (e.g., "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all")

```
