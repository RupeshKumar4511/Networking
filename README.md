# Important Point from IP addresses :
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be generated by a modem or router using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

# Important Point from Port numbers.
In networking, every application or service running on a device uses a port number to ensure that data is delivered to the correct application.

Modem: Connecting to your ISP and converting signals for internet access.
By itself, a modem usually connects to one device only (e.g., a single computer).
<br>
Routers have a global (public) IP address assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP), and this address is used for communication with servers on the internet. 
<br>
When the server sends the response to the router's global IP address then
the router uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to forward the data to the correct device in your local network.
<br>

# LAN , MAN , WAN 
Example of LAN : Home wifi router, office wifi router.
<br>
Example of MAN : Public Wifi Network provided across a city and local ISP's.
<br>
Example of WAN : Optical fibres and large ISP like TaTa ISP.

# Flow Control 
Flow control refers to a technique in data communication that ensures the sender and receiver operate at compatible speeds, so the receiver is not overwhelmed by data it cannot process in time. 

# MAC Addressing :
A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication on a physical network. It is used in the Data Link Layer of the OSI model to ensure devices can be uniquely identified within a local network.
<br>
When a device knows another device's IP address but not its MAC address, it uses ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) to map the IP to the corresponding MAC address.
<br>
A computer's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters have different MAC addresses because each network interface controller (NIC) in a device is assigned its own unique MAC address.

#  BitTorrent 
It is a prime example of a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture, where devices (peers) communicate directly with each other without relying on a centralized server for data exchange.

# SSL 
SSL/TLS is often associated with the Session Layer because it establishes, manages, and terminates secure sessions between devices.
<br>

# Ephemeral ports 
These are temporary ports assigned by a computer's operating system to a client application for the duration of a communication session when several tabs of a single application like Chrome. These ports are used for outbound connections and are automatically allocated from a predefined range when needed.

# TCP 
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) establishes a reliable connection between a client and a server before transferring data.
